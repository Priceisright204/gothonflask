# gothonflask
An implementation of "Learn Python the Hard Way" with Flask (better!).

See https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex52.html
And also look at https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex43.html

It is a simple web choose-your-own-adventure game.
The correct answers are "tell a joke", then you have to guess the random number,
then "slowly place the bomb", then randomly pick pod one or two.

I have implemented chapter 52 using FLASK instead of WEB.
Then I have fixed all of the bugs and enabled the features from the command-line version into the web app.
